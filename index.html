					Ever notice living miles away from a supermarket? If you answered yes, you are living in a food desert. The term refers to people who have limited access to a variety of healthy food options. These regions often feature large proportions of households with low incomes and inadequate access to transportation, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture. A decade ago, the department researched and found "23.5 million people live in low-income areas that are further than 1 mile from a large grocery store or supermarket," and the New York Times found 750,000 residents living in food deserts. Here are ways to access healthy food options near you:

					 There are several health risks that people living in food deserts are exposed to. They have a greater risk of diet-related conditions, like obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A healthy diet should include a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, protein, and dairy, which can be difficult to achieve for those living in food deserts. The lack of healthy options can contribute to conditions like high blood pressure. Community gardens, community fridges and farmers' markets are feasible alternatives to gain access to healthy food options.
